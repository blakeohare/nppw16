# How to use this file
# first non empty line is either the map name (without "maps/" or ".map")
# second line is the x, y coordinate (commad delimited)
# lines afterwards are flags that are to be set when the game starts
# flgas:
# - GRAVITY
# - VOLCANO1
# - VOLCANO2
# - VOLCANO3
# - WATER1
# - WATER2
# - WATER3

# ---Example---
# grav_core
# 3, 3
# GRAVITY
# VOLCANO1

# ^ this example starts you towards the top left corner of
# the grav_core map after the gravity and first volcano
# missions are complete.

# On the other hand just change the contents to "IGNORE"
# and this file will be ignored outright.

IGNORE
