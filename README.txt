STORY
	You have landed on the moon and are trying to terraform it. Terraforming
	occurs in 4 phases:
		- restoring gravity
		- restoring geological activity
		  (and thus allowing the atmosphere to reaccumulate)
		- restoring water
		- restoring flora

	After each phase, physics and your environment may change, unlocking new passageways
	and physics.


CONTROLS

	It is highly recommended that you use a Game Pad instead of the keyboard. This
	is a platformer designed in the style of NES games and is optimized as such.

	Keyboard:

	Arrow keys / NES D-Pad
		Move the main character
		Up and Down to climb up and down ladders.
